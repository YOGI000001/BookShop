There is an article in the Daily Telegraph estimating that one can go round the world in eighty days. Phileas Fogg, a rich English gentleman, engages in a conversation with his partners at whist about the possibility of it. and this is what it leads to: “I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes, that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes. Do you accept?”And soon, Fogg is on the 8.45 p.m. train to Italy from London with his French servant, Passe-partout. From trains to steamers to elephants, as Fogg travels across the four continents and different time zones, braving the unexpected, will he be able to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days? Will Phileas Fogg win the bet?Written during the Franco-Prussian War, Jules Verne’s Around the World in Eighty Days is a thrilling and lively adventure novel.

A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel - a black man falsely charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much. To Kill a Mockingbird is a coming-of-age story, an anti-racist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition.\",\n    book_url:\n      \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Z9p5AecCL._SX307_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\",\n    print_length: \"320 pages\",\n    language: \"English\",\n    author_name: \"Harper Lee\",\n    price: \"138\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: 7,\n    book_name: \"Do Epic Shit\",\n    book_description:\n      \"Ankur Warikoo is an entrepreneur and content creator whose deep, witty and brutally honest thoughts on success and failure, money and investing, self-awareness and personal relationships have made him one of India’s top personal brands.
